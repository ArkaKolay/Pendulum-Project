# Pendulum-Project

This project was done the summer of 2024, and will still be improved on. The goal was to create a rotary inverted pendulum using 3D printing, to make algorithms for control systems. The layout consisted of Solidworks designs for the actual pendulum, a microcontroller, 2 encoders, and 1 gearbox motor. The motor driver is powered by a 12 V source, which gives power to the motor with encoder as well. The motor driver also connects to the microcontroller which links to both encoders to determine the positions and directions of the pendulum arm. The actual code in the above file shows the Arduino Mega results for how to move the arm where it stays in the upright position. There are functions used which determine the speed, direction, and position of the arm and beam.
